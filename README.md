🚀 Career Path Predictor










📖 Overview

Career Path Predictor is an AI-powered platform that helps users explore and plan their career journey with confidence. In today’s rapidly evolving job market, choosing the right career path can be challenging. This project leverages machine learning, skill analysis, and AI-driven recommendations to provide personalized career guidance.

Users can create profiles, input their skills, and instantly receive tailored suggestions for potential career paths. Beyond simple recommendations, the system provides skill gap analysis, job market insights, and targeted learning resources to help users prepare for their chosen direction. A built-in AI chat advisor acts like a virtual career coach, offering conversational, real-time guidance.

The application features a dashboard where users can save recommendations, track their progress, and revisit skill-building resources. With a secure authentication system (login, signup, and password recovery), the platform ensures a private and personalized experience.

From a development perspective, the project is built on Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, ensuring performance, scalability, and modern UI design. API routes power backend logic, while AI integrations (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.) enable intelligent insights and natural conversations.

Whether you’re a student choosing a path, a professional considering upskilling, or someone exploring a career switch, Career Path Predictor empowers you with data-driven, AI-enhanced career decisions.
